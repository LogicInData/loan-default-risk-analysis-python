##  LOAN DEFAULTERS RISK ANALYSIS USING PYTHON

This repository contains an end-to-end data analysis project focused on understanding the key factors influencing loan defaults. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical insights, this project highlights patterns and correlations in the dataset that could be useful for risk assessment and decision-making.

# Project Overview

The primary objective of this analysis is to:

Understand customer characteristics related to loan defaults.
Identify potential risk factors.
Provide actionable insights through visualization and statistical analysis.

# Dataset
The dataset includes various features such as:

Loan Amount
Interest Rate
Employment Length
Annual Income
Issue Date
Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
Delinquency
Earliest Credit Line
Open Credit Accounts
Revolving Utilization

# Key Steps Performed

ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values and inconsistencies.
Feature engineering for improved analysis (including binning using Excel formulas).

ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Univariate Analysis

Loan Amount Distribution
Interest Rate Distribution
Annual Income Spread
Employment Length Frequency
Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) Analysis
Delinquency Counts
Revolving Utilization Plot

# Bivariate Analysis

Loan Amount vs Interest Rate
Annual Income vs Loan Status
Employment Length vs Default Rate
DTI vs Loan Status

# Statistical Analysis

Key descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, skewness).
Hypothesis testing for significant differences between defaulters and non-defaulters.

# Visualizations ðŸ“ˆ

Histograms for continuous variables.
Bar plots for categorical variables.
Box plots to highlight outliers and distributions.
Correlation heatmaps.
Count plots for default distribution.

# Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Excel (for feature binning)
